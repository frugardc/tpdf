    <h3>Our Mission</h3>
    <br>
    The whole idea behind the Peter Dukeman Foundation is to create a true non-profit organization built
    with one goal, to help people. We wanted a place people can go to donate their time, and work hands-
    on with their less fortunate neighbors who need assistance. A place where people can donate money,
    and actually see where it goes. Every dollar collected by the Peter Dukeman Foundation goes back out
    the door and is accounted for on our website. The “books” will be online. If we collect cash, we post
    the amount and a link to the receipt of what it bought. None of our volunteers, employees or board
    members receives pay-checks and our highest ranking company official’s title is Founder and Chief
    Volunteer. New York State law only requires non-profit organizations to donate 10% of what they
    collect. 10%!!! Where does the other 90% go? From being on the ground in the hardest hit areas of this
    natural disaster, I can tell you first hand it does not go to the people who need it.
    <br>
    <br>
    A key component to what we do is an extensive vetting process on the front end, for both volunteers
    and assistance recipients. To sign up as a volunteer, at any level, you have to pass a background check
    and be approved by at least two board members or our Founder. We need to know your heart is in
    the right place and you fully understand our mission. To sign up for assistance, you need to fill out a
    small application and provide character references or proof of your story. Each recipient will meet with
    one or more of the board members to determine eligibility. Once you are certified as a volunteer, or a
    recipient, you are family. We will do everything in our power to help you, in every way we can.

    <h3>Our Beginning</h3>
    <br>
        The story of the Peter Dukeman foundation began with the most destructive natural disaster to ever
        hit the North East United States, Superstorm Sandy. It wrought destruction of biblical proportions,
        destroying everything in its path, homes, beaches, even families. The day after the storm subsided, our
        Founder was sitting on his couch with his family, feeling blessed that everyone was safe and watching
        the devastation on television. He came across a facebook post from a remarkable woman named
        Maureen Ciuffo, a nurse, volunteering her time at one of the evacuee shelters, Queens College. The
        facebook post said hundreds of men, women and children were bused in and they were cold and dirty
        and had just lost all of their worldly possessions. The volunteers were able to shower these people but
        had no clothes to put them in. I messaged her that I wanted to help and my wife Stacey and I drove to
        our local K-Mart. We bought all of the sweatpants, underwear, t-shirts and socks we could fit in two
        carts and drove it over to Queens College. The look on this woman’s face blew me away. Here she was
        caring for these people who were all but broken, and she started crying when she saw the bags full of
        clothes.

        I went home, thinking about the faces of the people in the shelter and I wanted to do more. This was
        one evacuation center. There were dozens, and even more people who refused to leave still trapped in
        what was left of their homes. I took to the Internet and explained what I had witnessed to my friends
        and family. That night I started doing pickups of gently used clothing, food and supplies all over my
        neighborhood, Middle Village, Queens. I would either run what I collected right over to Queens College
        or stockpile it in my house for larger deliveries.
        <br>
        The next day I had several people calling and emailing, all with the same message; they wanted to help
        but they did not know how. There were so many requests by 10:00 AM that I asked everyone to meet
        me at my kid’s school, St. Margaret of Middle Village, for one big drop off point at 12:00 noon. Within
        minutes, there were close to 100 cars lined up around the blocks waiting to drop off. I opened the
        gymnasium and volunteers started pouring in. We opened tables up and started sorting everything in to
        specific clothing types, supplies, food and water. By the end of the day, Queens College, who had taken
        in another 300 evacuees over night, had everything they needed.

        We started sending shipments to other evacuation centers and directly in to the hardest hit areas. We
        had pickup trucks, minivans, cars and even one 20’ truck someone donated, all going back and forth.
        By the end of the second day, we had grown so big that we no longer fit in the gym. Word of our relief
        effort exploding spread fast and I was getting calls from all over asking for support. One of the calls
        came from Councilman Ulrich’s office, asking if we could stock his truck for deliveries. I was also put
        in contact with Councilmember Elizabeth Crowley, which turned out to be exactly what we needed to
        grow. Councilmember Crowley and her unbelievable staff had secured an abandoned bookstore in Atlas
        Mall in Glendale Queens. It was the perfect size and even had a loading dock. We quickly moved our
        operation in, along with all of our volunteers, which at this point numbered in the hundreds. We were a
        full blown relief effort, supporting our neighbors who had suffered so much by delivering much needed
        food, water, medical and cleaning supplies, blankets, jackets, clothes and just about anything else they
        could possibly need.

        We hit our stride that weekend, sending more than 70 shipments out in one day, including trucks,
        school buses, pickups, minivans and even a City bus provided by Local 1056. You can fit a lot of supplies
        in a City bus and we packed that bus 4 times. Our operation was humming for two straight weeks and
        we were supplying vital resources to some of the hardest hit areas. There was little sleep for our diehard
        volunteers and most of us can remember bits and pieces, but it’s basically a blur.

        Special thanks to Councilmember Crowley, her two aides Dori Pliska and Eric Yun, Joe Rabito, Donald
        Lawrence, Richie (need last name), The Redmond Family, The Trainor family, Local 1056, the NYPD,
        the FDNY and the very much under-appreciated Sanitation department. They worked around the clock
        helping people, cleaning up and they are still digging us out of this unbelievable mess. Rest in peace to
        all of our neighbors that we lost and God speed to all of our new friends who are rebuilding. We are with
        you and the Peter Dukeman Foundation will not rest until we have done everything humanly possible to
        get these hard working New York families back on their feet.

    <h3>Our Beginning</h3>
    <br>

    The relief effort in the weeks after the storm turned out to be Phase 1 of our mission. Phase 2 came as
    the Red Cross and FEMA started to show up and our deliveries became less of a necessity. We still had
    the network of volunteers and donors and we wanted to keep this going. I teamed up with a remarkable
    young man named Michael Sciaraffo, who had an idea to deliver toys to the kids affected by the storm
    dressed up as Santa Claus. His idea took off and he was having difficulty keeping up with demand. We
    put our network to work and we were able to raise more than $2000 and deliver hundreds of toys to
    Michael and directly to the kids. Our Founder was interviewed by the Associated Press and made the
    local news for our efforts.

    Right after the Holiday season ended, we began Phase 3 of our relief initiative and that is where we are
    today. The Peter Dukeman Foundation is now working directly with families displaced by the storm. We
    are providing everything from help finding housing, to help with gutting and restoring damaged homes,
    to mold remediation and furniture. This latest effort is to get people back to where they were pre-storm,
    to some form of semblance. We are building beds for kids sleeping on air mattresses, delivering dining
    room sets to people with empty apartments, providing washer / dryers and other appliances vital for
    everyday life and we are doing it all at no cost to the people we are helping.

    <h3>Our Beginning</h3>
    <br>
    Our Foundation’s namesake, Peter Dukeman, was a phenomenal person, a loving husband and an
    adoring father. He spent his spare time handing out food and blankets to homeless people and very
    few of his friends and even his family knew anything about his philanthropic work. He was a very giving
    man and the type of person we all aspire to be. Peter Dukeman passed away from a heart attack at the
    very young age of 40. We work in his name to carry on his memory. He is survived by his wife, Maureen
    Dukeman, and his 3 sons, William Dukeman, Daniel Dukeman and Peter Dukeman. William is an active
    member of the FDNY. Daniel is a security guard at the Metropolitan Opera House while attending
    college at night and the youngest of the three, Peter, is a full time student. Maureen is involved in the
    Foundation and will oversee our Operations to make sure we meet the standards her Husband would
    have demanded in helping others.
